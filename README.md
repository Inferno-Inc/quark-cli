## Examples of usage scenarios

Increase efficiency and reduce cost for your project/team！

Quark-CLI allows you to develop business components across multiple technology stacks/frameworks directly in daily development. For example, a marketing pop-up window of the same style can do:

- Running in front-end projects of different technology stacks (Angular, Vue, React, etc.) at the same time
- Run in different versions of the technology stack at the same time, such as running in Vue2.x, Vue3.x at the same time
